Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.
Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.
For example,
Given s = "Hello World",
return 5. 

Bonus:
1. Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.
The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
For example: the array is [ 2 4 6 2 8], the value is 2, the output should be [4 6 8] the new array length is 3
