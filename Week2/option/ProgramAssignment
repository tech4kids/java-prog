1. Create a program that asks the user to input 5 integers, print out the 5 integers value, then sort the number in ascending order and print them. 

2. Create a program that asks the user to input N integers, print out the N integers value, then sort the number in ascending order and print them; if you have time, find the best, worse case in the algorithm you've chose.
