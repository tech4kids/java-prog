Create a class called circle contains:
1. Two private instance variables: 
	radius (of type double)
	color (of type String)
	default radius is 1.0, color is "red"
2. Two constructors, one is default Circle(), one is Circle(double r, String color)
3. Two public methods:
	getRadius()
	getArea()
	getColor()

Create a PrintCircle program:
1. create an instance of that circle with default value
2. create an instacce of circle with the value you would like to assign it:
3. print Circle radius and Circle area, and circle color.

Bonus:
1. In TestCircle, can you access the instance variable radius directly? try to use public varialble, then try again.
2. Add two public methods called setters for changing the radius and color
